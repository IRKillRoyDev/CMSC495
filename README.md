Welcome to our Home Buyer Information App! 

To run this application, first download (or clone) the main repository. Ensure Python 3.9 or newer is downloaded. 

In the main file, scroll until you find 'main.exe'. This file will launch the application, where both tools can be accessed.

This application has two main tools: the mortgage calculator and the home comparison tool. 

The mortgage calculator receives input from the user to determine the monthly payment and size of a mortgage loan. Information inputted includes house price, loan term, interest rate, and down payment amount. Input is validated to ensure only accepted data is entered. 

The home comparison tool is particularly useful for both prospective home buyers and real estate agents. Users can compare homes from a .CSV file against criteria such as bedroom and bathroom counts, square footage, and price. This can help buyers see what is typically sold within their budget and help real estate agents run comparisons against other homes to ensure homes are priced accurately. 

For more information on using each tool please read the User Guide.
